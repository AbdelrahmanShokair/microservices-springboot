## Spring Boot Microservices 

**How to Run the Applications (These instructions may be outdated)**

**Using Docker (Recommended)**

  **[Container Icon]** 1. **Build the applications and create Docker images:**
     ```bash
     mvn clean package -DskipTests
     ```

  **[Play Icon]** 2. **Start the applications using Docker Compose:**
     ```bash
     docker-compose up -d
     ```

**Without Docker (Not recommended for production)**

  **[Warning Icon]** 1. **Navigate to each microservice folder within the project directory.**

  **[Hammer Icon]** 2. **Build the application:**
     ```bash
     mvn clean verify -DskipTests
     ```

  **[Play Icon]** 3. **Start the application:**
     ```bash
     mvn spring-boot:run
     ```

**Note:** These instructions may be outdated, and it's highly recommended to use the new repository and tutorial for the latest version and best practices.

**Icons Used (Optional)**

* **Container Icon**:  (Replace with the actual icon path or URL)
* **Play Icon**: (Replace with the actual icon path or URL)
* **Warning Icon**: (Replace with the actual icon path or URL)
* **Hammer Icon**: (Replace with the actual icon path or URL)

**Alternative Approach:**

If you have a project website or documentation hosted elsewhere, you can link to an image or icon sprite from that location. This allows more flexibility in managing the visuals. 

**Remember to replace the placeholder icon descriptions with the actual paths or URLs to your desired icons.**
